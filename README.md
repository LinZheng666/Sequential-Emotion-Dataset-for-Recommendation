# The Sequential  EMotion-Aware Recommendation (SEMAR) dataset
The Sequential EMotion-Aware Recommendation (SEMAR) dataset, which contains three types of files: ratings (rating.csv), movie information (movie_info.csv), and temporal emotions (emotions.csv). Because the temporal emotion file (emotions.csv) is too large, we divided it into 14 small files, and the 14 small files need to be merged in order of serial number when using.
